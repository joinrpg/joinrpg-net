How to build locally
==

This guide presumes that you have Windows. If you have other OS, you should replace Windows-specific
components with respective counterparts. I.e. VS → VS Code.

1. Start with forking this repository on github.
1. Download [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/). Community Edition should be enough.
1. Recommended to install Github Extension (options during install). See more
   on https://visualstudio.github.com/.
1. Download .Net Core 5 SDK.
1.
Download [SQL Server Express LocalDB 2017](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/F/2/EF23C21D-7860-4F05-88CE-39AA114B014B/SqlLocalDB.msi)
and important!
download the
latest [cumulative update for SQL Server 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4047329/sql-server-2017-build-versions)
  1. Create an instance of localdb from command prompt, if you don't have
     any </br>`sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocalDB`
1. Input you github credentials into Visual Studio and clone your repository. Or clone repository
   using Git cmd client or Github for windows or whatever you like.
1. Perform the following git commands (you may need to restart VisualStudio in order to see newly
   added remote repository under TeamExplorer):
  - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/joinrpg/joinrpg-net.git`
  - `git fetch upstream`
1. Compile VS project and observe package restoring and everything happens
1. Tap F5 and you should be there.
1. First start can take a long time while Local DB will create database for first time.
  1. If you got error about "The argument 2 of the JSON_MODIFY should be string literal", you have
     outdated version of LocalDb. Updating it could be tricky,
     see [here](https://knowledge-base.havit.eu/2018/09/04/sql-localdb-upgrade-to-2017-14-0-1000/)
  1. If you don't have Joinrpg/App_Data folder in your solution directory, create it. Otherwise you
     may get `System cannot find the file specified` error on database creation stage.
1. Some features will be disabled — it's all about integration to Remote systems — email, social
   services login etc. If you want to test this, you will need to provide correct keys in
   appsettings.json.
1. First logged-in user will have his email automatically confirmed and adminstrator flag will be
   set. If you want more users, you have to change DB or setup mail integration.

Submitting your changes
==

1. 1 branch = 1 feature.
1. Test your changes locally, etc.
1. Execute `dotnet format`, to apply project's code styles
1. Commit.
