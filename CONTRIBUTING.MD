How to build locally (on Windows)
==

There is instruction for **Windows**. It's theoretically possible to build on Linux/MacOS, but I don't know how, so contributions welcome!

1. Start with forking this repository on github. 
1. Download [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/). Community Edition should be enough.
1. Recommended to install Github Extension (options during install). See more on https://visualstudio.github.com/.
1. Download .Net Framework 4.6 and .Net Framework 4.6 SDK.
1. Input you github credentials into Visual Studio and clone your repository.
  - Or clone repository using Git cmd client or Github for windows or whatever you like.
1. Perform  
	- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/joinrpg/joinrpg-net.git`
	- `git fetch upstream`
1. Compile VS project and observe package restoring and everything happens
1. Tap F5 and you should be there.
1. First start can take a long time while Local DB will create database for first time.
1. Some features will be disabled — it's all about integration to Remote systems — email, social services login etc. 
If you want to test this, you will need to rename Secret.config.example to Secret.config and provide correct keys.
1. Please note that you won't be able for login until you verify your email. Of course, it's not possible w/o email integration enabled.
To perform that, you will need to go to database and change `[dbo].[UserAuthDetails]` to set `[EmailConfirmed]` for corresponding user.

Submitting your changes
==
1. I recommend that you will have separate branch for each feature, but that's on you.
1. Test your changes locally, etc.
1. Commit.
1. Rebase your changes on top of `upstream/master`
1. Open pull request via Github UI from your branch to `joinrpg/joirpg-net/master`
